The dashboard visualizes data from a cleaned subset of approximately 5,000 customer records, drawn from the Kaggle Credit Score Classification dataset.

I’ve focused on critical metrics such as age, occupation, annual income, credit history length, and credit score, ensuring data integrity by addressing missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates. The visualizations—crafted in Power BI offer a clear, interactive view to support our lending decisions, and I encourage you to explore the filters for deeper insights.
